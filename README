NAME
    Class::Accessor::Assert - Accessors which type-check

SYNOPSIS
      use Class::Accessor::Assert;
      __PACKAGE__->mk_accessors( qw( +foo bar=Some::Class baz ) );

DESCRIPTION
    This is a version of Class::Accessor which offers rudimentary
    type-checking and existence-checking of arguments to constructors and
    set accessors.

    To specify that a member is mandatory in the constructor, prefix its
    name with a "+". To specify that it needs to be of a certain class when
    setting that member, suffix "=CLASSNAME". Unblessed reference types such
    as "=HASH" or "=ARRAY" are acceptable.
